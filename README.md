# PY-SIDs-Project
### Project Synopsis:
To prevent SIDS by using an app to monitor movement, temperature, and breathing patterns.

### Project Description:
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death of a baby less than one year old. Thousands of babies die in the U.S. each year without any apparent reason or warning signs. Although there is not a single cause of SIDS, there are many factors that can put a baby at risk for it. This project explores many major causes of SIDS and there are many factors that can put a baby at risk for it. The project explores three major causes of SIDS: suffocation from an infant rolling over onto its stomach, overheating, and respiratory infection. Programming for each of these modes will be uploaded to the Circuit Playground: a single board microcontroller containing features such as an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, an alarm, and buttons. An application is also created to alert parents if any of these causes are met.

### Instructions
Follow these steps to program your Circuit Playground to be directly functional with running CircuitPython:

Then simply load the code into the file that pops up when you enter bootloader mode.
